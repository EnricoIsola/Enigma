The program creates a randomly ordered two-dimensional matrix based on the
    letters of the English alphabet (plus a space). The operator types a text
    that is encrypted through the matrix itself. Each letter is converted into
    two numerical coordinates that correspond to the position of the letter
    within the matrix. (Naturally, a letter may appear multiple times in the
    matrix, and its coordinates are extracted randomly.)

the process proceeds in reverse, from the encrypted string that is passed
    to the decoding matrix to retrieve the original text.
